Deadlock avoidness is better when we do not care about following losses:
• Future resource requirements must be known in advance
• Processes can be blocked for long periods
• Exists fixed number of resources for allocation
Deadlock Prevention is better use when the following is not crucial for our implementation:
•long waiting time required
•inefficient use of allocated resource
•A process may not know all the required resources in advance
Deadlock recovery is better when we do care about the following constraints:
 • This technique does not limit resources access or restrict process action.
 • Requested resources are granted to processes whenever possible.
 • It never delays the process initiation and facilitates online handling.
 • The disadvantage is the inherent pre-emption losses.

If we need good execution speed it is better to use
Deadlock recovery as it spends a lot of time only if deadlock have appeared.

If the save process termination  is required for us, deadlock avoidness becomes the best solution.
With some speed losses and resource allocation limitations.

If we want to decrease a probability of deadlock to 0, it is better to use deadlock prevention. However that approach has many limitations and make execution slower.
