Exercise 5:
    What is the difference between a physical and a virtual address?
Virtual addresses are not real, they make an illusion of full memory space access and used only by active processes,
also virtual memory can be more than maximum device memory capacity(in that case data will be cashed on hard disk),
with physical memory it cant apear as it already hard disks space.

Physical addresses are real enough and represents the real structural cell of memory in hardware, used only by hardware system modules
